## Description
TeachNotes was an app I developed while I was an attendee at Apple's Worldwide Developers Conference in 2014. It was designed to be a simple and unified way for substitute or drop-in teachers to access prepared lesson plans and class-specific notes. It also provided a mechanism for the substitute teacher to write comments about their experience and interaction with students for teachers and staff to review at a later time.
